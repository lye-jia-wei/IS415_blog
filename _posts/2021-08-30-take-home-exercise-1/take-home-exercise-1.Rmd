## 1. Introduction

Since late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19; 
previously known as 2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan, China, which had 
subsequently affected 210 countries worldwide. In general, COVID-19 is an acute 
resolved disease but it can also be deadly, with a 2% case fatality rate.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Indonesia 
on March 2, 2020. It started with two cases in March. As of July 31 2021, there 
had been 3,409,658 cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Indonesia and 
94,119 reported cumulative deaths. All cases were spread in 34 provinces in 
Indonesia. Among all the provinces, DKI Jakarta (Indonesian: Daerah Khusus 
Ibukota Jakarta and in English: Special Capital Region of Jakarta) contributed 
close to 24% of the cumulative confirmed cases.



## 2. Problem Statement 

Given that the cumulative confirmed cases were not evenly distributed within DKI Jakarta, this geospatial analysis aim to

- Reveal the spatial-temporal patterns of COVID-19 case in DKI Jakarta 
- Find out sub-districts with relatively higher number of confirmed cases
- Identify trends of COVID-19 case in the sub-districts and how they change over time.

## 3. Data

In this analysis, the following dataset were used:

```{r, layout="l-body",table.with=2}

Data <- c("Jakarta COVID-19 Data", "DKI Jarkata shapefile")
Format <- c("XLSX", "Shapefile")
Description <- c("Daily COVID-19 data of DKI Jakarta month between March 2020 to July 2021", "Jakarta sub-district")
Source <- c("[Open Data Covid-19 Provinsi DKI](https://riwayat-file-covid-19-dki-jakarta-jakartagis.hub.arcgis.com/)",
"[Indonesia Geospatial Data](https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/p/sitemap.html)")


data_set <- data.frame(Data,Description,Format, Source)

knitr::kable(head(data_set))
```
*Note: Jakarta COVID-19 data file for last day of each month is used with the 
exception of missing file for 31 January 2021, hence 30th January 2021 data set 
is used*


## 4. Getting Started

In this exercise, the key R package use is tmap package in R. Beside
tmap package, seven other R packages will be used. They are:

- sf for handling geospatial data,
- tidyverse for subsetting and transforming data 
- ReadXL for importing XLSX file
- plotly for data visualization
- dplyr for data maniupulation
- plyr for splitting, applying and combining Data 
- tmap to produce thematic map
- spdep to create spatial weights matrix objects 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
packages <- c('sf','tidyverse','readxl','plotly','dplyr','plyr','tmap','spdep')
for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

## 5. Data Import

### 5.1 Importing Geospatial Data Into R

Import the data and examine the content of the data set.

-Data will first be imported as an sf object to facilitate data pre-processing 
and initial analysis, then converted to sp class in the later part of the 
analysis.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE} 

DKI_Jakarta = st_read(dsn="data/geospatial",layer="BATAS_DESA_DESEMBER_2019_DUKCAPIL_DKI_JAKARTA")
```

The message above reveals that the geospatial objects are multipolygon features. 
There are a total of 269 multipolygon features and 161 fields in DKI_Jakarta simple 
feature data frame. DKI is in WGS84 projected coordinates systems. 


### 5.2 Importing Attribute Data Into R

Next, we will import monthly Covid-19 data XLSX file from a folder into RStudio 
and save it into an R dataframe called Covid_DF.

#### 5.2.1 Reading XLSX File

The task will be performed by using lapply() in combination with read_xlsx() 
function to identify all the xlsx file and then applying a function to 
transform the file in the File_List as shown in the code chunk below. We will 
also be adding 'Date' field to extractthe date from file name in the subsequent step. 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE} 

File_List <- list.files(path = "C:/Users/User/Desktop/IS415/lye-jia-wei/IS415_blog/_posts/2021-08-30-take-home-exercise-1/data/aspatial" , pattern = "*.xlsx",  full.names = T)

DF_List <- lapply(seq_along(File_List), function(x) transform(read_xlsx(File_List[x]), Date = File_List[x]))

```

#### 5.2.2 Creating Dataframe

We will then convert the DF_List into dataframe called Covid_DF using the ldpy 
function. This will be a temporary dataframe which we will then carry out data 
cleaning in the later step.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE} 
Covid_DF <- ldply(DF_List, data.frame)
```


## 6. Data Extraction, Wrangling and Integration

### 6.1 Geospatial Data

#### 6.1.1 Data Cleaning 

First, we have to ensure that spatial data used for analysis has no invalid geometries.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
length(which(st_is_valid(DKI_Jakarta) == FALSE))

```
- There are no invalid geometries in the data that needs to be handled.


Check the geospatial data for missing values, as missing values can impact future 
calculations.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
DKI_Jakarta[rowSums(is.na(DKI_Jakarta))!=0,]
```
- From the output, we can see that object ID 25645 and 25646 has missing value
for the column 'KAB_KOTA' and 'KECAMATAN' amongst other column

- 'KODE DESA' format is inconsistent with the other data in the same column

Hence, we will proceed to drop the two rows with the following code chunk

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE} 

DKI_Jakarta <- na.omit(DKI_Jakarta,c("DESA_KELUR"))
```



#### 6.1.2 Plotting the Geospatial Data

Let us now quickly visualize the DKI_Jakarta dataframe 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE} 
plot(DKI_Jakarta)
```
From the map, it is evident that DKI_Jakarta consists of outer islands which
is not part of our intended study area. We will look into that after we check
the projected coordination system.




#### 6.1.3 Define Projection

- The spatial data of Jakarta (Indonesia) is utilised in this analysis.

- Initial data exploration reveals that data is to be projected
with the World Geodetic System 1984 datum.
- The corresponding EPSG code is EPSG: 23845.
- The CRS of the data will be checked, then assigned accordingly.
- Unit of measurement will be in metres.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
st_crs(DKI_Jakarta)
```
#### 6.1.4 Assigning a coordinate system 

Although DKI_Jakarta data frame is projected in WGS84 but when we read until 
the end of the print, it indicates that the EPSG is 4326. This is a wrong EPSG 
code because the correct EPSG code should be 23845.

In order to assign the correct EPSG code to DKI_Jakarta data frame as well
as to set the national projeted coordinates systems of Indonesia whhich is DGN95, 
st_transform is used as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
DKI_Jakarta <- st_transform(DKI_Jakarta, 23845)

```

Let us check the CSR again to ensure that changes are reflected

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

st_crs(DKI_Jakarta)
```

- We have successfully assign DGN95:23845 as the projection for the data.


#### 6.1.5 Removing Outer Islands

To exclude all the outer islands from the DKI_Jakarta dataframe, we will plot
an interactive map to identify the mainland.

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}

tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(DKI_Jakarta)+
  tm_fill()
```
From the initial exploration, it can be found that Object_ID greater than 25383
consists of the island. Hence, we will proceed to filter them out.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

DKI_Jakarta <- filter(DKI_Jakarta, OBJECT_ID > 25383)


```




#### 6.1.6 NA, Geometric Validity Checks and Correction

To check if there are any NA values as a result of data manipulation in the previous step.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
DKI_Jakarta[rowSums(is.na(DKI_Jakarta))!=0,]
```




#### 6.1.7 Retain the first nine fields in the DKI Jakarta sf data frame

Since we are only interested in the first nine fields of the DKI_Jakarta sf
dataframe, we will only retain these columns.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

DKI_Jakarta <- DKI_Jakarta[, 0:9]
```

#### 6.1.8 Translating column name for DKI_Jakarta to English

For convenience and ease of comprehension, we will translate the DKI_Jakarta
column names to English. 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

DKI_Jakarta <- DKI_Jakarta %>% 
  dplyr::rename(
    Total_Population=JUMLAH_PEN, Sub_District=DESA_KELUR, District=KECAMATAN, 
    City=KAB_KOTA, Province=PROVINSI, Village=DESA, ID=KODE,
    Village_Code=KODE_DESA, Object_ID=OBJECT_ID
    )

```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

DKI_Jakarta$Total_Population <- as.numeric(DKI_Jakarta$Total_Population)
```


### 6.2 Aspatial Data


#### 6.2.1 Understanding Temp_Covid_DF

To better understand the data structure of Temp_Covid_DF, we will inspect it
quickly. 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
head(Covid_DF)
```

While combining the different XLSX file into the dataframe, it resulted in 
duplicated columns. Hence, the next step is to remove these duplicated columns
as well as other irrelevant columns. 


#### 6.2.2 Coalesce 'ID_KEL' & 'Meninngal' column

A quick glance at dataframe suggest that there are duplicated  'ID_KEL' column.
Hence, coalesce needs to be done to ensure that all the ID are present one single
ID column. 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Covid_DF <- Covid_DF %>% 
  mutate(ID_KEL = coalesce(ID_KEL, ID_KEL...1, ID_KEL...2))

```


We will then repeat this step for the 'Meninngal' column. Before we 
coalesce the various Meninggal column, we will have to change the data 
type of the column as they are of different data type.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Covid_DF$Meninggal...26 = as.double(Covid_DF$Meninggal...26)


Covid_DF <- Covid_DF %>% 
  mutate(Meninggal = coalesce(Meninggal, Meninggal...28, Meninggal...29, Meninggal...30, Meninggal...31, Meninggal...26))

```

#### 6.2.3 Extract Column of Interest

While there are many columns in Temp_Covid_DF, the relevant columns for analysis
are: 

- Name_provinsi (Province)
- name_kota (City)
- nama_kecamatan (District)
- nama_kelurahan (Sub-district)
- Meninggal (Deaths)
- POSITIF (Covid Cases)
- month
- ID

Hence, we will be only be retaining the 8 columns and this is done by selecting
the column name.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Covid_DF <- Covid_DF %>% select("Date","ID_KEL", 
                                          "Nama_provinsi", "nama_kota", 
                                          "nama_kecamatan", "nama_kelurahan", 
                                          "POSITIF", "Meninggal")

```

#### 6.2.4 Adding in 'Date' Column 

Since the focus of this analysis will require the time period of the cases,
we will add a 'Date' column. 

A quick look at the XLSX file suggest that a pattern exist:

XLSX File Name: Standar Kelurahan Data Corona (28 Februari 2021 Pukul 10.00).xlsx

The date is formatted as DD-Month-YYY in bracket right before ( and the word 'Pukul'.
Hence, we will use regular expressions to extract the date.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Covid_DF$Date <- str_extract(Covid_DF$Date,"(?<=Data Corona \\().*(?= Pukul)")

```


By looking through Temp_Covid_DF, we can see that the month is spelled in 
Bahasa Indonesia which is the national adminstrative language of Indonesia.
With that, we have to set locale to Indonesia and format the date.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Sys.setlocale(locale="ind")
Covid_DF$Date  <- c(Covid_DF$Date ) %>% as.Date(Covid_DF$Date , format ="%d %B %Y")

```
#### 6.2.5 Translating column name of Covid_DF to English

Next, we will translating column name to English for ease of comprehension 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Covid_DF <- Covid_DF %>% 
  dplyr::rename(
    Death=Meninggal, Cases=POSITIF, Sub_District=nama_kelurahan, 
    District=nama_kecamatan, City=nama_kota, Province=Nama_provinsi, ID=ID_KEL
  )
```


#### 6.2.6 Dropping Columns 

Quick inspection of Covid_DF dataframe suggest that there are non-numeric
data in the "ID" column such as:

- BELUM DIKETAHUI
- PROSES UPDATE DATA
- LUAR DKI JAKARTA

Hence, we will proceed to drop these rows. 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
Covid_DF <-Covid_DF[!is.na(Covid_DF$ID),]

Covid_DF <-Covid_DF [!(Covid_DF$ID=="BELUM DIKETAHUI" | Covid_DF$ID=="PROSES UPDATE DATA" | Covid_DF$ID=="LUAR DKI JAKARTA") ,]

```


#### 6.2.7 Changing Data Type of Column 


```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

#Changing Cases data type from character to numeric

Covid_DF$Cases <- as.numeric(Covid_DF$Cases)




Covid_DF$Death[is.na(Covid_DF$Death)] = 0

Covid_DF$Death <- as.numeric(Covid_DF$Death)






```





## 7. Study Area 

To better understand the study area and Jakarta_Covid dataframe, tmap is used to plot
choropleth map to quickly visualize spatial relation of Covid-19 cases and 
deaths in Jakarta respectively.

### 7.1 Joining the Attribute Data & Spatial Data

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Jakarta_Covid <- left_join(DKI_Jakarta, Covid_DF,
                          by = c("Province" = "Province","Sub_District" = "Sub_District",'City'='City'))

```



### 7.2 Preliminary Choropleth Map of Covid-19 Cases in Jakarta 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(Jakarta_Covid)+
  tm_fill("Cases",minimize = TRUE) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) 

```


### 7.3 Preliminnary Choropleth Map of Covid-19 Death in Jakarta 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(Jakarta_Covid)+
  tm_fill("Death",minimize = TRUE) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) 

```

From the two maps, it is evident that there are missing cases and death data. 
Hence, in the following segment, we will be investigating the reason behind the
missing data and determine if additional data cleaning needs to be done.  


## 8. Data Inspection & Data Cleaning Round 2 

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}

View(Jakarta_Covid)
View(DKI_Jakarta)
View(Covid_DF)
```

After inspecting the Jakarta_Covid dataframe, it appears that there are spelling
error for data in the 'Sub-District' column for DKI_Jakarta and Covid_DF
e.g 'KRAMAJATI' vs 'KRAMAT JATI' which resulted in missing data when joining 
the aspatial & spatial data.


### 8.1 Identifying Missing Sub-District

To establish a systematic way of checking for missing values, we will
compare the two data frame - DKI_Jakarta and Covid_DF. The following code chunk 
will identify the missing 'sub-district' values.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
Covid_SD <-c(Covid_DF$Sub_District)
Jakarata_SD <-c(DKI_Jakarta$Sub_District)


Covid_SD[!(Covid_SD %in% Jakarata_SD)]

```
From the output, it is evident that the following sub-districts are spelled 
incorrectly:

- KRAMATJATI (Correct: 'KRAMAT JATI')
- PAL MERAH (Correct 'PALMERAH')
- PALMERIAM (Correct: 'PAL MERIAM')
- KALIBARU (Correct: 'KALI BARU')
- RAWAJATI (Correct: 'RAWA JATI')
- JATIPULO (Correct: 'JATI PULO')
- KRENDANG (Correct: 'KERENDANG')
- PINANGRANTI (Correct: 'PINANG RANTI')
- BALEKAMBANG (Correct: 'BALE KAMBANG')
- HALIM PERDANA KUSUMA (Correct: HALIM PERDANA KUSAMAH)
- KALI DERES (Correct: KALIDERES)

Apart from spelling mistakes,there were also sub-districts value that have
have missing word

- TENGAH (Correct: 'KAMPUNG TENGAH')


### 8.2 Clean Sub-District Data

The following code chunk corrects the misspelt sub-district in preparation for
joining the attribute data & spatial data in the next step. 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
DKI_Jakarta <- DKI_Jakarta %>% mutate(Sub_District = ifelse(as.character(Sub_District) == "KRAMATJATI", "KRAMAT JATI", as.character(Sub_District)))
DKI_Jakarta <- DKI_Jakarta %>% mutate(District = ifelse(as.character(District) == "PAL MERAH", "PALMERAH", as.character(District)))
DKI_Jakarta <- DKI_Jakarta %>% mutate(Sub_District = ifelse(as.character(Sub_District) == "PALMERIAM", "PAL MERIAM", as.character(Sub_District)))
DKI_Jakarta <- DKI_Jakarta %>% mutate(Sub_District = ifelse(as.character(Sub_District) == "KALIBARU", "KALI BARU", as.character(Sub_District)))
DKI_Jakarta <- DKI_Jakarta %>% mutate(Sub_District = ifelse(as.character(Sub_District) == "RAWAJATI", "RAWA JATI", as.character(Sub_District)))
DKI_Jakarta <- DKI_Jakarta %>% mutate(Sub_District = ifelse(as.character(Sub_District) == "TENGAH", "KAMPUNG TENGAH", as.character(Sub_District)))
DKI_Jakarta <- DKI_Jakarta %>% mutate(Sub_District = ifelse(as.character(Sub_District) == "JATIPULO", "JATI PULO", as.character(Sub_District)))
DKI_Jakarta <- DKI_Jakarta %>% mutate(Sub_District = ifelse(as.character(Sub_District) == "KRENDANG", "KERENDANG", as.character(Sub_District)))
DKI_Jakarta <- DKI_Jakarta %>% mutate(Sub_District = ifelse(as.character(Sub_District) == "PINANGRANTI", "PINANG RANTI", as.character(Sub_District)))
DKI_Jakarta <- DKI_Jakarta %>% mutate(Sub_District = ifelse(as.character(Sub_District) == "BALEKAMBANG", "BALE KAMBANG", as.character(Sub_District)))
DKI_Jakarta <- DKI_Jakarta %>% mutate(Sub_District = ifelse(as.character(Sub_District) == "HALIM PERDANA KUSUMA", "HALIM PERDANA KUSUMAH", as.character(Sub_District)))
Covid_DF<- Covid_DF %>% mutate(District = ifelse(as.character(District) == "KALI DERES", "KALIDERES", as.character(District)))


```


### 8.3 Joining the Attribute Data & Spatial Data

To check the sub_district data, we will have to left join the DKI_Jakarta dataframe
and Covid_DF dataframe again.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Jakarta_Covid <- left_join(DKI_Jakarta, Covid_DF,
                          by = c("Sub_District" = "Sub_District"))

```


### 8.4 Checking Sub-District Data

Plotting the cases against the map of Jakarta to verify that all the misspelled
sub-district and district are corrected.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(Jakarta_Covid)+
  tm_fill("Cases") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) 
```

- From the output, we can see that all the data are now corrected. 


## 9. Writing and Reading RDS

### 9.1 Writing RDS

Next, we will use the write_rds() function to export the data frame. 

```{DS echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
write_rds(Covid_DF, file ="Covid_DF.rds")
write_rds(DKI_Jakarta, file ="DKI_Jakarta.rds")
```

### 9.2 Read RDS

```{DS echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

Covid_DFG <- read_rds("C:/Users/User/Desktop/IS415/lye-jia-wei/IS415_blog/_posts/2021-08-30-take-home-exercise-1/Covid_DF.rds")
DKI_Jakarta <- read_rds("C:/Users/User/Desktop/IS415/lye-jia-wei/IS415_blog/_posts/2021-08-30-take-home-exercise-1/DKI_Jakarta.rds")

```

## 10. Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Case_Rate <- Covid_DF %>%
  inner_join(DKI_Jakarta, by=c("Sub_District" = "Sub_District")) %>%
  group_by(Sub_District, Date) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(`Cuml_Case_Rate` =  ((sum(Cases) / (Total_Population ))*10000)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% pivot_wider(names_from = Date,
              values_from = Cuml_Case_Rate)


summary(Case_Rate)
```
- Based on summary statistics,  there is generally an increase in the number of 
COVID-19 cases in Jakarta with time between March 2020 and July 2021 , as 
observed from the increasing mean COVID-19 case rates across the months.




## 11. Thematic Mapping 

To better understand the spatio-temporal distribution of COVID-19 at the sub_district level, choropleth mapping techniques will be utilised for the analysis.

Choropleth maps visualising the spatial distribution of COVID-19 rates across sub_district in Jakarta, will be plotted across time (March 2020 to July 2021).
Covid Cases Per 10k Population will be visualised instead of the number of COVID-19 cases to standardised population sizes for a more holistic comparison.

#### 11.1 Cumulative Confirmed Cases 

#### 11.1.1 Data preparation
The following code chunk will inner join join the attribute data (Covid_DF) & 
spatial data (DKI_Jakarta). 


Following which, the cumulative confirmed cases per 10,0000 population will be
calculated using the following formula:

$$ Monthly\ Cumulative\ Confirmed\ Cases\  = 
\frac{Total\ no\ of\ Covid-19\ cases\ at\ Sub-District\ 
Level}{Total\ Population\ of\ the\ Sub-District} \ *\ 10,000$$

After which, we will then covert Jakarta_Covid_Cases into sf.  

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Jakarta_Covid_Cases <- Covid_DF %>%
  inner_join(DKI_Jakarta, by=c("Sub_District"="Sub_District")) %>%
  group_by(Sub_District, Date) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(`Cases Per 10k Population` = ((sum(Cases) / (Total_Population ))*10000)) %>% ungroup()

Jakarta_Covid_Cases <- Jakarta_Covid_Cases%>% left_join(DKI_Jakarta, 
                       by=c("Sub_District"="Sub_District"))

Jakarta_Covid_Cases<- st_as_sf(Jakarta_Covid_Cases)

```



          
#### 11.1.2 Plotting Choropleth Map of Monthly Cumulative Confirmed Cases 

In the code chunk below, tm_shape() is used to define the input data 
(Jakarta_Covid_Cases) and tm_fill() is used to illustrate the monthly cumulative
confirmed cases at sub-district level. 



Classification Method

Custom breaks will have to be specified explicitly to construct the classification 
scheme for Covid Cases Per 10k Population.

To guide the specification of breakpoints, descriptive statistics of Covid Cases Per 10k Population across months
are first computed and studied.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

summary(Jakarta_Covid_Cases["Cases Per 10k Population"]) 
```

- It can be observed that Covid Cases Per 10k Population rate range from 0 to 3808 across sub district, from March 2020 to July 2021.

Break Point

To choose an appropriate number of classes, we will use the sturges formula
$$ No\ of\ Classes = 1 + 1.32 * Log (Number\ of \ Values)$$

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
Classes=1+ 1.32* log(4176)
Classes
```
With the result and considering legibility, we will set the number of classes to 
be 7

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
Classes=1+ 1.32* log(4176)
Classes
```

The choropleth map is plotted with custom classification scheme.  

```{r fig.width=16, fig.height=10}


Jakarta_Covid_Cases_March <- Jakarta_Covid_Cases %>% filter(Date == "2020-03-31")


tmap_mode("plot")+
tm_shape(Jakarta_Covid_Cases_March)+
tm_fill("Cases Per 10k Population", breaks = c(0, 4, 13, 53, 119, 270, 395, 3808), 
legend.is.portrait = TRUE) +
tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
tm_layout(main.title = "Cumulative Confirmed Cases per 10,000 population \n of Jakarta sub-district - March 2020" ,
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.85,title.size = 0.30,
            legend.outside = FALSE,legend.title.size = 1.40, legend.text.size = 1.10,
            legend.position = c("left", "bottom"),
            frame = TRUE)+
  tm_compass(type="4star", size = 4) + 
  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15)+
  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) 

```


- From the choropleth map, it can observe that in March 2020, the sub-district with 
the highest case per 10k population is around south-west Jakarta, specifically Senayan.

- A darker shade of oranange indicates a higher COVID-19 rate per 10k population.

- It is also interesting to note that sub_district near Senayan such as Gelora 
and Karet Semmangi, Rawa Barat appears to have higher COVID-19 rate per 10k population
compared to other sub-district.






#### 11.1.3 Time-series choropleth map of COVID-19 Rates


By using tm group by date in TM_FACETS, we can see the spatial-temporal patterns 
of COVID-19 case in DKI Jakarta between March 2020 to July 2021.

```{r fig.width=16, fig.height=25}

tm_shape(Jakarta_Covid_Cases) +
  tm_fill("Cases Per 10k Population", breaks = c(0, 4, 13, 53, 119, 270, 395, 3808),
          thres.poly = 0,palette = "Reds") + 
  tm_facets(by="Date", 
            free.coords=TRUE,

  tm_layout(legend.show = TRUE,
            title.position = c("center", "center"), 
            title.size = 10,main.title = "Cumulative Confirmed Cases per 10k population In Jakarta Sub-District", legend.outside = FALSE,legend.width = 0.70, legend.text.size = 1.5, legend.position = c("left", "bottom"), panel.label.size = 2.0) +

  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)


```
- It can be observed that COVID-19 cases seem to spread outwards to the neighbouring sub-district with time.

- In the first 3 month (Mar 2020 - May 2020), it appears that COVID-19 cases are mostly concentrated around the central and western Jakarta. 

- By August 2020, sub-district with the highest COVID-19 cases per 10k population (darker red areas) are mostly found in central jakarta 

- In the first half of 2021, COVID-19 cases per 10k population appears to spread throughout Jakarta. However, it is to noted that due to the
large class interval of 395 to 3808, difference between the various sub_district may not be apparently from April 2021 onwards. 

#### 11.1.4 Animated Time-series choropleth map of COVID-19 Rates

To better visualize the changes across the various sub-district through time,
we will plot an animated map with the same data.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}


Covd_Cases_Animation= tm_shape(Jakarta_Covid_Cases)+ tm_fill("Cases Per 10k Population", breaks = c(0, 4, 13, 53, 119, 270, 395, 3808) ,palette = "Reds") +  tm_facets(along = "Date", free.coords = FALSE)
  
  
tmap_animation(Covd_Cases_Animation,file="C:/Users/User/Desktop/IS415/lye-jia-wei/IS415_blog/_posts/2021-08-30-take-home-exercise-1/Covid_Case_Animation.gif" , delay = 45)

#### 12.2 Cumulative Covid-19 Death

##### 12.2.1 Data Preparation
The following code chunk will omit rows with missing month values and join
the attribute data (Covid_DF) & spatial data (DKI_Jakarta). 

Following which, the cumulative death per 10,0000 population will be
calculated using the following formula:

$$ Monthly\ Cumulative\ Confirmed\ Death\  = 
\frac{Total\ no\ of\ Covid-19\ Death\ at\ Sub-District\ 
Level}{Total\ Population\ of\ the\ Sub-District} *\ 10,000$$

After which, we will then covert Jakarta_Covid_Cases into sf. 


```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}


Jakarta_Death <- Covid_DF %>%
  inner_join(DKI_Jakarta, by=c("Sub_District"="Sub_District")) %>%
  group_by(Sub_District, Date) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(`Death Per 10k Population` = ((sum(Death) / (Total_Population)))* 10000)  %>% ungroup()

Jakarta_Death  <- Jakarta_Death %>% left_join(DKI_Jakarta, 
                       by=c("Sub_District"="Sub_District"))

Jakarta_Death <- st_as_sf(Jakarta_Death )



```


#### 10.2.2 Plotting Choropleth Map of Monthly Cumulative Death

In the code chunk below, tm_shape() is used to define the input data 
(Jakarta_Death) and tm_fill() is used to illustrate the monthly cumulative
confirmed cases at sub-district level. 



Classification Method

Custom breaks will have to be specified explicitly to construct the classification 
scheme for Covid Death Per 10k Population.

To guide the specification of breakpoints, descriptive statistics of Covid Death Per 10k Population across months
are first computed and studied.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

summary(Jakarta_Death["Death Per 10k Population"]) 
```

- It can be observed that Covid Death Per 10k population rate range from 0 to 42across sub district, from March 2020 to July 2021.

Break Point

To choose an appropriate number of classes, we will use the sturges formula
$$ No\ of\ Classes = 1 + 1.32 * Log (Number\ of \ Values)$$

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
Classes=1+ 1.32* log(4176)
Classes
```
With the result and considering legibility, we will set the number of classes to 
be 7



The choropleth map is plotted with custom classification scheme.  

```{r fig.width=16, fig.height=10}


Jakarta_Death_March <- Jakarta_Death %>% filter(Date == "2020-03-31")


tmap_mode("plot")+
tm_shape(Jakarta_Death_March)+
tm_fill("Death Per 10k Population", breaks = c(0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14), 
legend.is.portrait = TRUE) +
tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
tm_layout(main.title = "Cumulative Death per 10,000 population \n of Jakarta sub-district - March 2020" ,
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.85,title.size = 0.30,
            legend.outside = FALSE,legend.title.size = 1.40, legend.text.size = 1.10,
            legend.position = c("left", "bottom"),
            frame = TRUE)+
  tm_compass(type="4star", size = 4) + 
  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15)+
  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) 

```

- From the map, it can be seen that Gondangdia and Senayan are the 2 sub-district with 
the highest Covid death in March 2020. 


#### 12.2.3 Time-series choropleth map of COVID-19 Rates


By using tm group by date in TM_FACETS, we can see the spatial-temporal patterns 
of COVID-19 death in DKI Jakarta between March 2020 to July 2021.

```{r fig.width=16, fig.height=25}

tm_shape(Jakarta_Death) +
  tm_fill("Death Per 10k Population", breaks = c(4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32),
          thres.poly = 0,palette = "Reds") + 
  tm_facets(by="Date", 
            free.coords=TRUE, 
            drop.shapes=TRUE) +
  tm_layout(legend.show = TRUE,
            title.position = c("center", "center"), 
            title.size = 10,main.title = "Cumulative Death per 10k population In Jakarta Sub-District", legend.outside = FALSE,legend.width = 0.70, legend.text.size = 1.5, legend.position = c("left", "bottom"), panel.label.size = 2.0) +
  tm_compass(type="4star", size = 2) + 
  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15)+
  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)

```


- From the map, it is evident that despite the high covid case per 10k population
shown earlier starkly contrast with the map depicitng covid death per 10k population. This may suggest that Covid-19 death rate is relatively low in 
the earlier period e.g March 2020 to Dec 2020

- By Feb 2021, one particular sub-district, Gambir stood out as it is the only sub-district with a high (24-28) death per 10k population 

- Death per 10k population increases sharply after May 2020 and appears to be higher in Central Jakarta. The sharp rise in death per 10k population may
be a result of the more fatal Covid-19 Delta variant, though additional statistical testing needs to be conducted to prove this hypothesis. 



#### 12.1.4 Animated Time-series choropleth map of COVID-19 Rates

To better visualize the changes in death rate across the various sub-district through time,
we will plot an animated map with the same data.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}


Covd_Death_Animation = tm_shape(Jakarta_Death)+ tm_fill("Death Per 10k Population", breaks = c(4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32) ,palette = "Reds") +  tm_facets(along = "Date", free.coords = FALSE)
  
  
tmap_animation(Covd_Death_Animation, delay = 45)
```

### 13. Analytical Map

#### 13.1 Barchart

To better understand Jakarta sub-district which has been affected by Covid-19 
the most in terms of infection rate and death rate, we will now proceed to
plot bar chart that shows the top 10 district with highest Covid-19 cases 
and death from March 2020 to July 2021. 


##### 13.1.1 Bar Chart of Top 10 Sub-District With Highest Covid-19 Cases Per 10,000 Population

###### 13.1.1.1 Combining aspatial and spatial dataframe

Again, we will combine the Covid_DF and DKI_Jakarta data frame by sub_district.
We will use the same formula to calculate the Covid cases per 10,000 population
and it will be named as 'Covid_Case_10K'.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Jakarta_Covid_Sub_District <- Covid_DF %>%
  left_join(DKI_Jakarta, by=c("Sub_District"="Sub_District")) %>%
  group_by(Sub_District) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(`Covid_Case_10k` =((sum(Cases) / (Total_Population ))*10000)) %>% ungroup()

```

###### 13.1.1.2 Dropping duplicated and NA Rows

Next, we will get drop the duplicated row as well as the NA rows.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Jakarta_Covid_Sub_District <-Jakarta_Covid_Sub_District[!duplicated(Jakarta_Covid_Sub_District), ]

Jakarta_Covid_Sub_District$Covid_Case_10k <- round(Jakarta_Covid_Sub_District$Covid_Case_10k ,0)
```

###### 13.1.1.3 Plotting barchart 

Following which, we will sort the sub_district by covid cases per 10k population
and only plot the top 10 sub_district with highest covid cases.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

top_n(Jakarta_Covid_Sub_District, n=10, Covid_Case_10k) %>%
          ggplot(., aes(x=Covid_Case_10k, y=reorder(Sub_District, Covid_Case_10k),label= (Covid_Case_10k)))+
              geom_bar(stat='identity')+ 
  geom_col(fill='darksalmon') +
  labs(title='Top 10 Sub-District With Highest Covid-19 Cases Per 10k Population',
       x='No of Covid Cases',
       y='Sub-District') +
  geom_text(nudge_x=-900.85,vjust = 0.5, colour='gray23', size=2.87) +
  theme_minimal()

```
- From the barchart, we can see that Gambir is the sub district with the highest
Covid-19 cases per 10k population in Jakarta between March 2020 and July 2021. 

- To note that the top 3 sub-districted highlighted in the barchart
are located close to each other as seen from the Choropleth map


##### 13.1.2 Bar Chart of Top 10 Sub-District With Highest Covid-19 Death Per 
10,000 Population

###### 13.1.2.1 Combining aspatial and spatial dataframe

Again, we will combine the Covid_DF and DKI_Jakarta data frame by sub_district.
We will use the same formula to calculate the Covid death per 10,000 population
and it will be named as 'Death_Per_10K'.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Jakarta_Death_Sub_District <- Covid_DF %>%
  left_join(DKI_Jakarta, by=c("Sub_District"="Sub_District")) %>%
  group_by(Sub_District) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(Death_Per_10k = ((sum(Death) / (Total_Population ))*10000)) %>% ungroup()

```

###### 12.1.1.2 Dropping duplicated and NA Rows

Next, we will get drop the duplicated row as well as the NA rows.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Jakarta_Death_Sub_District <-Jakarta_Death_Sub_District[!duplicated(Jakarta_Death_Sub_District), ]

Jakarta_Death_Sub_District$Death_Per_10k <- round(Jakarta_Death_Sub_District$Death_Per_10k ,0)
```

###### 12.1.1.3 Bar Chart

Following which, we will sort the sub_district by covid death per 10k population
and only plot the top 10 sub_district with highest covid death.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

top_n(Jakarta_Death_Sub_District, n=10, Death_Per_10k) %>%
          ggplot(., aes(x=Death_Per_10k, y=reorder(Sub_District, Death_Per_10k),label= (Death_Per_10k)))+
              geom_bar(stat='identity')+ 
  geom_col(fill='darksalmon') +
  labs(title='Top 10 Sub-District With Highest Covid-19 Death Per 10k Population',
       x='No of Death',
       y='Sub-District') +
  geom_text(nudge_x=-7.85,vjust = 0.5, colour='gray23', size=2.87) +
  theme_minimal() + theme(plot.title = element_text(size=10))



```

- As pointed out previously in the Choropleth map, Gambir has one of the highest Covid-19 death per 10k population 

- Again, we can observe that the top sub-district with highest Covid-19 death per 10k population appears to be geographically near to one another

- To note, the top 10 district with highest Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 death per 10k population differs slightly. 


#12.2 Box Map 

A box map will be used to visualise covid cases spatially across different sub_district
in Jakarta. 

A customised classification scheme for the choropleth map will be constructed 
using the basic principles of a box plot.This ensures that data classification 
is not manipulated, and that the data is visualised accurately to represent 
the real-world situation. The box map will enable statistical interpretation 
of outliers and better identification of subzones that have relatively higher 
or lower demand compared to the rest of the subzones. In this analysis, data 
points will be considered outliers if they are more than 1.5 times interquartile 
range.


The following code chunks are functions to construct the box map.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}


# To create break points for box map

boxbreaks <- function(v, mult=1.5) {
  qv <- unname(quantile(v))
  iqr <- qv[4] - qv[2]
  # upfence and lofence define the area where points will be defined as outliers
  upfence <- qv[4] + mult * iqr
  lofence <- qv[2] - mult * iqr
  # initialize break points vector
  bb <- vector(mode="numeric",length=7)
  # logic for lower and upper fences
  if (lofence < qv[1]) { # no lower outliers
  bb[1] <- lofence
  bb[2] <- floor(qv[1])
  } else {
  bb[2] <- lofence
  bb[1] <- qv[1]
  }
  if (upfence > qv[5]) { # no upper outliers
  bb[7] <- upfence
  bb[6] <- ceiling(qv[5])
  } else {
  bb[6] <- upfence
  bb[7] <- qv[5]
  }
  bb[3:5] <- qv[2:4]
  return(bb)
}


# Extract variable as vector out of dataframe
get.var <- function(vname, df) {
  v <- df[vname] # %>% sf::st_set_geometry(NULL)
  v <- unlist(v) # unname(v[,1])
  return(v)
}


# Boxmap function
boxmap <- function(vnam, df, mtitle, legtitle=NA, mult=1.5, palette='-RdBu') {
  df1 <- drop_na(df)
  var <- get.var(vnam,df1)
  bb <- boxbreaks(var)
  tm_shape(df) +
    tm_fill(vnam,
            title=legtitle,
            breaks=bb,
            palette="Blues",
            labels = c("Lower outlier", "< 25%", "25% - 50%", "50% - 75%","> 75%", "Upper outlier")) +
  tm_borders(lwd=0.1, alpha=1) +
  tm_layout(main.title = mtitle,
            main.title.position = 'center',
            main.title.size = 1,
            frame = TRUE,legend.title.size = 0.70, legend.position = c("left", "bottom")) +
  tm_compass(type="4star", size = 2) + 
  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.10)+
  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
}


# Boxmap function with points overlayed on top of choropleth map
boxmap_pts <- function(vnam, df, pointdf, mtitle, legtitle=NA, mult=1.5, palette='-RdBu') {
  boxmap(vnam, df, mtitle, legtitle=legtitle, mult=mult, palette=palette) +
  tm_shape(pointdf) +
    tm_dots(col="gray23")
}


```

We will now use the function using the previous constructed dataframe, Jakarta_Covid_Cases
to display summary statistics. 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Covid_Cases_Boxmap <- boxmap("Cases Per 10k Population", Jakarta_Covid_Cases, mtitle="Jakarta Covid Cases (Mar 2020 - July 2021)")
Covid_Cases_Boxmap 
```
- In line with the previous observation, the upper outlier lies mainly in the region
of central Jakarta 



#12.3 Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) 

Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) estimates the proportion of deaths among identified confirmed cases.To verify one of the earlier stated hypothesis
that Covid-19 have low fatality rate, we will use the following formula:


$$ Case\ Fatality\ Rate\ = 
\frac{Total\ no\ of\ Covid-19\ Death\ at\ Sub-District\ 
Level}{Total\ Covid-19\ Cases\ of\ the\ Sub-District} *\ 100$$

The case fatality rate represents the proportion of cases that eventually die from a disease.

We will create a new dataframe called Merged_DF to calculate the CFR.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}


Merged_DF <- Covid_DF %>% select('Cases', 'Sub_District','Death')

Merged_DF<- left_join(DKI_Jakarta, Merged_DF, by= c("Sub_District" = "Sub_District")) %>% group_by (Sub_District) %>% dplyr::summarise(`Case Fatality Rate` = (sum(Death) / (sum(Cases))) *100) %>% ungroup()


```


Next, we will plot the result on the map using jenks classification method

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
tmap_mode("plot")+
  tm_shape(Merged_DF)+
  tm_fill("Case Fatality Rate",n = 5, style="jenks",
          legend.is.portrait = TRUE) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) of Jakarta (Mar 2020- July 2021) ",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 0.75,title.size = 0.30,legend.title.size = 0.70, 
            legend.outside = FALSE,
            legend.position = c("left", "bottom"),
            frame = TRUE)+
  tm_compass(type="4star", size = 2) + 
  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.10)+
  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) 

```
- From the result, there appears to be difference in case fatality rate across sub-district in Jakarta 

- In line with earlier observation, CFR appears to be higher in Central Jakarta region
